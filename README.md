# What Happens:

- Who buzzed in first
- The time it took
- Fun feedback like "üéâ You're first!" or "‚è±Ô∏è 1.5s"
- You can also log response times for multiple attempts.

# Notes:
- This uses Nordic UART UUIDs (6e4000xx) ‚Äî make sure Puck.js is advertising that (which it does via Bluetooth.println()).
- It connects once and listens.
- The TextDecoder is available on Bangle.js for BLE data ‚Äî no need to polyfill.
